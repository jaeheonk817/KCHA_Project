# KCHA_Project

# Overview
This data science project uses multiple linear regression analysis techniques to build a reliable, statistically significant model for predicting housing prices in Kings County, Seattle. The data will contain home sale prices from May 2014 to May 2015, from King County's government records. The stakeholder is KCHA, Kings County Housing authority, a public agency that provides affordable housing options and services to low-income families, individuals, and seniors in King County. Their particular concern is providing homes for a family of five or more people. This project will help them to make data-driven well-informed decisions on making future services and polices.

# Business Problem
## Who is King County Housing Authority?
The KCHA is a public agency that provides affordable housing options and services to low-income families, individuals, and seniors in King County. They aim to help improve the quality of life for residents in the area by providing safe, decent, and affordable housing options, as well as supportive services and programs.
## What are their headaches?
- The metropolitan area has a severe shortage of affordable housing, and KCHA is working to address this issue, possibly due to the concentration of large corporate campuses in the Seattle area.
- However, the presence of these high-earning populations and corporate campuses makes it challenging to acquire new affordable housing units, requiring extreme precise mathematical precision.
- The housing market in Seattle is experiencing significant turbulence:
 - Housing prices have seen a sharp increase following the pandemic.
 - Rising interest rates are driving up mortgage rates.
 - The potential for an economic recession adds to the uncertain outlook of the housing market.
 - The presence of nearby tech campuses and potential for tech lay-offs further complicates the situation.
 - KCHA asked to provide a housing price prediction model that can accomodate a family of any size.
