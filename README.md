# KCHA_Project

# Overview
This data science project uses multiple linear regression analysis techniques to build a reliable, statistically significant model for predicting housing prices in Kings County, Seattle. The data will contain home sale prices from May 2014 to May 2015, from King County's government records. The stakeholder is KCHA, Kings County Housing authority, a public agency that provides affordable housing options and services to low-income families, individuals, and seniors in King County. Their particular concern is providing homes for a family of five or more people. This project will help them to make data-driven well-informed decisions on making future services and polices.
